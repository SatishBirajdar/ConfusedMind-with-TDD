# ConfusedMind-with-TDD
This application is to select a random item from the List. Don't get confused between what to choose. Leave it to the application.  For example, - Your spouse or girlfriend or boyfriend has many choices at any moment of time, but gets confused on what to choose. - In an Enterprise, during daily stand-ups avoid the moment, "Who should start the meeting?".
